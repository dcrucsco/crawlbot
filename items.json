Greer, who for the past four years has helped to maintain NASA\u2019s official Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram accounts, is said to go about his job each day under the impression that, as social media manager, he is one of the thousands of men and women working tirelessly to advance humankind\u2019s exploration of outer space. \u201cEvery day at NASA, we\u2019re conducting groundbreaking research and making new discoveries, and it feels incredible being part of something so critical to the future of our society,\u201d said Greer, whose job consists of uploading images, copying and pasting text, shortening links to stay under Twitter\u2019s 140-character limit, and responding to comments online. \u201cEveryone here\u2014from the guys designing new propulsion methods to our astronauts living aboard the International Space Station\u2014plays an important role, and it takes all of us working together to accomplish our missions.\u201d  \u201cWe really are a well-oiled machine,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s enough of a reward just to be surrounded by the type of people who are always challenging and pushing one another to reach greater heights. We really bring out the best in one another.\u201d Citing the   probe\u2019s Pluto flyby and the   rover\u2019s landing on Mars as examples, Greer told reporters it was hard not to take immense pride in the landmark achievements he and his colleagues have made since he was first hired to run NASA\u2019s social media presence. Greer, who majored in communications at DePaul University and joined NASA after a summer marketing internship with the e-commerce site Groupon, added that behind the agency\u2019s awe-inspiring feats are countless long days and sleepless nights that most Americans never see. The employee tasked with curating the agency\u2019s LinkedIn page was also quick to point out that at NASA, he and his fellow staff members are always expected to place the mission ahead of their own personal egos. Greer stressed that whether they are gathering data from space telescopes, devising next-generation technologies to enable extraplanetary habitation, or repromoting posts from the agency\u2019s Tumblr account, neither he nor his coworkers are concerned with claiming individual credit for their contributions. Furthermore, Greer said, he and the agency\u2019s engineers, physicists, and crewmembers were essentially one large family. \u201cPreparing for the last [International Space] Station resupply required all hands on deck,\u201d Greer said of the recent mission, which he documented and shared on Twitter and Instagram using the hashtag #NASASocial. \u201cThe technicians were working around the clock to monitor the rocket, the meteorologists were closely assessing atmospheric conditions, and the whole time I was juggling tweets covering the launch with that week\u2019s Periscope tour of the Kennedy Space Center.\u201d \u201cIt was so exhausting, but at the same time, it was extremely exciting to have been part of it,\u201d he continued. \u201cEspecially the moment when I could just step back and watch the posts go live.\u201d While stating that he thoroughly enjoys his work, Greer admitted to reporters that with so much at stake in their day-to-day operations, he, like everyone at NASA, tends to place an enormous amount of pressure on himself to avoid letting down his colleagues. The man responsible for posting clips of NASA press conferences to YouTube went on to say that when he is feeling burnt out from the demands of the job, he needs only to remind himself of the millions of young Americans who NASA is inspiring every single day. \u201cWhat I like most about working here is that although this job is incredibly demanding, I get to show up each day knowing we\u2019re really doing something meaningful,\u201d said the man who has the ability to queue up several hours\u2019 worth of social media posts ahead of time, allowing him to sometimes leave work as early as 2 p.m. \u201cIt\u2019s enough of a reward just to be surrounded by the type of people who are always challenging and pushing one another to reach greater heights. We really bring out the best in one another.\u201d Added Greer: \u201cThis job isn\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s a high-stress environment, but man, it\u2019s such a payoff when we take a look at everything we\u2019ve accomplished.\u201d", "title": "NASA Social Media Manager Considers Himself Part Of Team"},

The afternoon matchup, held between members of the Clinton campaign as a brief break from the grind of the election season, reportedly came to an end in the bottom of the ninth inning when Clinton sprinted down the third-base line and lowered her shoulder into the chest of the young catcher as he attempted to tag her for the final out. Sources confirmed that the violent collision, which sent both tumbling into the dirt as the ball popped loose, sealed an 8-7 victory for the former senator\u2019s side. \u201cShe was running with a full head of steam and absolutely leveled him\u2014you could hear the impact from the dugout,\u201d said senior policy advisor Jake Sullivan, noting that the close play at the plate came only after Clinton had ignored her teammates\u2019 shouts to remain at third base as she tagged up on a shallow flyout to left field. \u201cThe kid was doubled over, rolling around and moaning in pain. That\u2019s when everyone ran over to check to see if he was okay.\u201d \u201cThe entire time, Secretary Clinton was shouting that he dropped the ball and kept gesturing the \u2018safe\u2019 signal,\u201d he added. According to participants, the game-winning play marked the conclusion of what was described as an intense and aggressive performance by Clinton, who reportedly spent most of the game drenched in sweat, covered in dirt, and sporting a bloody lip as a result of diving after a ground ball. In addition to playing with little regard for the safety of herself or those around her, sources confirmed that the former first lady could often be seen taunting opposing players, both verbally and by pointing to the center-field fence before every at-bat. Witnesses also recalled a particularly tense moment midway through the game when Clinton charged from the dugout to angrily confront the game\u2019s lone umpire, political director Amanda Renteria, for ruling a teammate\u2019s outfield hit a foul. According to reports, the presidential candidate then spent approximately five minutes arguing the call as she clenched her crumpled-up baseball cap in her fist before eventually returning to the bench while muttering a string of profanities. Clinton reacted with equal displeasure after striking out in the fifth, when, according to reports, she slammed her bat into the dirt before flinging it against the backstop. \u201cWhen I was playing second base, she tried to break up a double play by sliding into me with her spikes up,\u201d media advisor Jim Margolis said of Clinton, adding that the former cabinet member also regularly violated the rule prohibiting players from leading on the basepaths. \u201cShe brushed herself off like nothing happened, and when I showed her the cut on my leg, she told me to rub some dirt on it and to \u2018quit acting like a little pussy.\u2019\u201d \u201cNow that I think about it, she was the only person even wearing cleats,\u201d he added. In addition to clashing with opponents, Clinton frequently directed her frustration toward her own teammates, sources confirmed, often belittling them for fielding errors or poor at-bats. Witnesses said that after chief pollster Joel Benenson bobbled a sharp ground ball hit his way at shortstop, Clinton furiously berated him in front of both teams before ordering him to play right field. Reports also indicated that Clinton refused to allow any of her teammates to pitch, citing her ability to \u201cput some serious spin\u201d on the underhand throws. \u201cBy the end of the game, I was trying to steer clear of her in the dugout,\u201d said communications director Jennifer Palmieri, who recalled Clinton kicking over a drink-filled cooler after popping out in the eighth. \u201cShe would just sit there at the far end of the bench staring down at the ground.

Further reports indicate that the split second between when he finished typing and the moment his search results appeared onscreen would be the last time Lang recognizes himself as the person he is now, as core aspects of the local bank manager\u2019s very identity will, according to sources, begin to undergo immediate and significant transformations. At press time, Lang was reportedly searching the phrase \u201ctender lump vs. tumor,\u201d an action ironically intended to stem the onrushing deluge of profound life changes, but which will only serve to greatly accelerate his entry into the next phase of his existence.", "title": "Man Googling \u2018Tender Lump On Neck\u2019 About To Begin Exciting New Phase In Life"},
